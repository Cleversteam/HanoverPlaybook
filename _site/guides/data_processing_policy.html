  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>At Cleversteam we take the security of our partner’s data very seriously and take strong measures to negate any potential risk.</p>

<p>This page outlines our general policy to protecting your data.</p>

<h2 id="ownership-of-data">Ownership of Data</h2>
<p>Cleversteam has always assigned ownership of data to our partners. This is part of our long term relationship strategy that we have with the people that we work with. It allows our partners more freedom to use the data as they wish.</p>

<p>It is our partner’s responsibility to ensure that the individual’s rights are respected and implemented. It is Cleversteam’s responsibility to work with our partners, and recommend best practices based on our experience.</p>

<h2 id="locations-of-data-storage">Locations of Data Storage</h2>
<p>We currently store our partner’s data in 3 locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> - Dublin (IE) and Frankfurt (EU) Data Centres</li>
  <li><strong>Rackspace</strong> - London (GB) Data Centre</li>
  <li><strong>Brightbox</strong> - Leeds (GB) Data Centre</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon deployment of a new project, we inform our partners of which data centre we intend to use for their data storage. We also notify and seek agreement for any to change this location.</p>

<h2 id="processing-records">Processing Records</h2>
<p>Whenever data is processed through our web systems, we keep a log of the transaction. The log files contain the fundamental information that happened in each transaction but does not contain any personal data apart from the IP address from which the transaction originated.</p>

<p>See “backup data” within the “data retention” section for the retention period on log files.</p>

<h2 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h2>
<p>We categorise data retention in two ways. Live data and backup data.</p>

<h3 id="live-data">Live Data</h3>
<p>Our policy is to retain data indefinitely unless one of the following circumstances is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data held has not been accessed for 6 months and is not required for a legal business purpose</li>
  <li>There is a local country legislation that states data must be held for a longer period</li>
  <li>Our partner has requested us to delete data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="backup-data">Backup Data</h3>
<p>We retain daily snapshots of our databases and file systems for 1 year.</p>

<h2 id="data-breach">Data Breach</h2>
<p>If our partners suspect a data breach of any kind, it should be reported immediately to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#097;&#109;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#097;&#109;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a></p>

<p>If we become aware of a data breach, we will notify our partner primary contact immediately.</p>

<p>Our team will then follow our internal processes to patch the issue and deploy the fix to all relevant places. After this, we will work with our partner to notify the relevant authorities and impacted individuals.</p>

<p>Finally a full breakdown of what happened and how it has been resolved will be supplied to our partner.</p>

<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>All of our web services use SSL with 256 bit encryption meaning data in transit is secure.</p>

<p>Our databases, file systems and backups are also encrypted when the data is in transit and at rest where possible.</p>

<h2 id="gdpr">GDPR</h2>
<p>It is our commitment to work with our partners to ensure that we build GDPR compliant systems.</p>

<p>We do this by providing mechanisms for data management, data portability, data erasure and many more aspects. This especially includes the data subjects access rights.</p>

<p>This is a key part of our <a href="https://www.cleversteam.com/uk/approach">approach</a> to building safe web and mobile systems.</p>

<p><strong>We refuse to carry out any request from our partner that infringes the GDPR.</strong></p>

<h2 id="termination-of-contract">Termination of Contract</h2>
<p>In the event that we stop working with one of our partners, Cleversteam will return all data, then completely destroy any copy that we have. We maintain that the data belongs to our partners and we have no lawful basis to hold it after the contract has ended.</p>
