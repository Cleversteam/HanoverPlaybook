Support Flow
============
1. Support request (known as a "ticket" from this point on) is received in [Asana](http://www.asana.com) from a Cleversteam Partner.
2. Within 24 hours, the ticket is responded to by Cleversteam. The partner can expect to receive a due date (within 3 working days), as long as the estimated time is not more than 1 hour. If the estimated time is greater than an hour, further discussion will be taken outside of the ticket and the original ticket will be closed.
3. The work will be carried out within the period of time communicated in step 2.
4. Once the work is completed, the ticket will be marked as complete and the partner will be informed, along with any extra information required.
5. If there is no response to step 4 from the partner within 1 working day, Cleversteam will assume that the provided solution is satisfactory and the ticket will assumed closed.
