Time Tracking
=============
Starting October 2019, we time track all projects. Time is tracked using [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) in combination with [Asana](https://asana.com).

We use time tracking for the following reasons:
* It helps us improve our scheduling and estimates
* It helps us identify where our team may need support on certain types of task
* It helps us improve our workflow

To track time in your work, the follow process should be adopted
1. [Link Harvest to your Asana account](https://asana.com/apps/harvest) this step only needs to be completed once
2. When you work on a ticket, click the stopwatch icon at the top of the task. This applies in the following circumstances:
 * When you are directly working on a task
 * When you are helping someone with a task
 * When you are testing a task
2. Note that a task does not have to be assigned to you for you to log time against it.
4. Make sure the correct project is selected in the pop up window
5. When you have finished working, click the stop watch icon again
